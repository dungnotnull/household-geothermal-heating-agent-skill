# CLAUDE.md — Skill 248: household-geothermal-heating

## Skill Identity
- **Skill Name:** `household-geothermal-heating`
- **Tagline:** Household Geothermal Heating System Design & Operation — Small-Scale Geothermal Heat Pump Engineering analysis & decision-support harness.
- **Current Phase:** Phase 0 — Architecture & Research
- **Folder:** `D:\972026\248-household-geothermal-heating\`

## Problem This Skill Solves

This skill provides a structured, evidence-backed analytical workflow for
**Small-Scale Geothermal Heat Pump Engineering**. It gathers authoritative real-time and reference data, applies
recognized domain methods, cross-references academic research, and delivers
actionable outputs that are fully evidenced, risk/limitation-disclosed, and
traceable to authoritative sources — continuously self-improving through an
automated knowledge crawl pipeline.

## Harness Flow Summary

```
/household-geothermal-heating invoked
│
├─ Step 1: sub-gather-requirements   → Clarify the object of analysis, constraints, timeframe, available inputs, target audience, and language before any data fetching.
├─ Step 2: sub-evidence-collector   → Fetch authoritative real-time and reference data for the object: current status/parameters, authoritative documents/standards, and recent developments from domain and academic sources.
├─ Step 3: sub-core-analysis   → Design and operate a household geothermal (ground-source) heating system: size heat pump, design ground loop, and optimize COP/economics.
├─ Step 4: sub-knowledge-updater   → Query SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN.md for authoritative academic and professional evidence; surface citations with tier labels and flag gaps for the crawl pipeline.
├─ Step 5: sub-advisor   → Synthesize all prior analysis into a risk-disclosed conclusion with a full evidence chain and recommended actions.
└─ Step 6: main (quality gate)       → verify evidence hierarchy, disclosure, output polish
